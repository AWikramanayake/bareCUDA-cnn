# bareCUDA-cnn
A Convolutional Neural Network written in CUDA (under construction!)

## Introduction
This is my first project in CUDA, so my code is far from perfect! This project aims to recreate the CNN described in [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/convolutional-neural-networks-from-the-ground-up-c67bb41454e1) (link appears to be broken, the article can be found via the Wayback Machine) in CUDA. The code for the Python/Numpy-based CNN in the article can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Alescontrela/Numpy-CNN).

The goal of this project is to optimize the CNN for my specific setup (a rather anemic 4050M) and see how close I can get to the performance of the original numpy-cnn and standard ML-library implementations of this network.
